"Good Morning, I'm Shuaibu. I've recently graduated with a degree in Computer Science from ISCG University. During my studies, I've gained hands-on experience with languages like Java, Go/Golang, Python, Frontend technologies like HTML, CSS, React js and Next js, and I've completed some projects which are on my github account. So currently I'm looking for an opportunity to apply my skills and learn from experienced professionals in a collaborative environment. I'm particularly excited about opportunities to contribute to scalable and efficient backend solutions. Thank you for considering me for this position."
