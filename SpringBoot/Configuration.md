In Spring Boot, a configuration refers to how your application components are set up and behave. It's about defining how different parts of your application interact and what settings they use. Configuration can be done in various ways, but a common approach is using annotations.

Here's a simplified explanation of configuration in Spring Boot with examples:

1. **Annotation-Based Configuration**: Spring Boot uses annotations to configure various aspects of your application.

   Example:
   ```java
   @SpringBootApplication
   public class MyApplication {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           SpringApplication.run(MyApplication.class, args);
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Properties Configuration**: You can configure your application using properties files where you define key-value pairs for settings.

   Example:
   ```properties
   # application.properties
   server.port=8080
   ```

3. **Bean Configuration**: You can define beans (components) and their dependencies using annotations like `@Component`, `@Service`, `@Repository`, etc.

   Example:
   ```java
   @Component
   public class MyComponent {
       // Bean definition
   }
   ```

4. **Dependency Injection**: Spring Boot facilitates dependency injection, allowing you to inject dependencies into your components automatically.

   Example:
   ```java
   @Service
   public class MyService {
       private final MyRepository repository;

       @Autowired
       public MyService(MyRepository repository) {
           this.repository = repository;
       }
   }
   ```

5. **Profile-Specific Configuration**: You can have configuration specific to different environments or profiles.

   Example:
   ```java
   @Configuration
   @Profile("development")
   public class DevelopmentConfiguration {
       // Configuration for development profile
   }
   ```

6. **Conditional Configuration**: You can conditionally include or exclude configurations based on certain conditions.

   Example:
   ```java
   @Configuration
   @ConditionalOnProperty(name = "myapp.feature.enabled", havingValue = "true")
   public class FeatureConfiguration {
       // Configuration for the feature if enabled
   }
   ```

These are some common ways to configure a Spring Boot application. Depending on your requirements, you may use one or more of these approaches to tailor the behavior of your application.
