As an entry-level backend engineer interviewing for a position involving Spring Boot, you can expect questions that assess your understanding of Java, Spring Framework, Spring Boot, and general backend development concepts. Here's a breakdown of what you might encounter:

1. **Core Java Concepts**: Expect questions related to basic Java concepts such as object-oriented programming, data structures, and algorithms. You may be asked about topics like inheritance, polymorphism, interfaces, collections, exception handling, and multithreading.

2. **Spring Framework**: Since Spring Boot is built on top of the Spring Framework, you should have a good understanding of Spring's core concepts like dependency injection, inversion of control (IoC), aspect-oriented programming (AOP), and Spring MVC.

3. **Spring Boot Fundamentals**: Interviewers might ask about the advantages of using Spring Boot, annotations commonly used in Spring Boot applications (e.g., @SpringBootApplication, @RestController, @Autowired), how Spring Boot simplifies application configuration, and its embedded server capabilities.

4. **RESTful Web Services**: Given the prevalence of RESTful APIs in modern applications, you may be asked about creating RESTful APIs using Spring Boot, HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), status codes, request/response formats (JSON, XML), and how to handle common scenarios like pagination, filtering, and error handling in RESTful services.

5. **Database Access and ORM**: Questions related to Spring Data JPA and Hibernate might come up. You should be familiar with creating entities, defining repositories, performing CRUD operations, handling transactions, and managing database relationships (e.g., one-to-many, many-to-many) using Spring Data JPA and Hibernate.

6. **Testing**: Expect questions about unit testing and integration testing in Spring Boot applications. You should know how to write test cases using frameworks like JUnit and Mockito, and understand the importance of testing for ensuring code quality and reliability.

7. **Security**: Security is a critical aspect of backend development. You may be asked about securing Spring Boot applications using techniques like authentication (e.g., OAuth, JWT) and authorization (e.g., role-based access control).

8. **Build Tools and Dependency Management**: You might encounter questions about Maven or Gradle, the two most commonly used build tools in Java development. Understand how to manage dependencies, create build configurations, and execute build lifecycle phases.

9. **Debugging and Troubleshooting**: Interviewers may present you with hypothetical scenarios or code snippets and ask you to identify issues, debug problems, or propose solutions.

10. **Software Design and Architecture**: While this may be more advanced for an entry-level position, having a basic understanding of software design principles (e.g., SOLID principles) and architectural patterns (e.g., MVC, REST) can be beneficial.

Remember to not only focus on theoretical knowledge but also be prepared to demonstrate practical coding skills through coding exercises or solving real-world problems during the interview. Additionally, showcasing any personal projects or relevant experience you have with Spring Boot can greatly enhance your candidacy.
