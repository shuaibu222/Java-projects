Sure, let's simplify the explanation of Spring MVC using Spring Boot with examples:

**1. Spring MVC**: It's a framework for building web applications in Java. It follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern, separating concerns between the data (Model), presentation (View), and user interaction (Controller).

**2. Spring Boot**: It's a tool that simplifies the setup and configuration of Spring-based applications. It helps to quickly create stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based applications.

**3. Example Scenario**: Let's say we want to create a simple web application to manage a list of books.

**4. Steps to Create Spring MVC using Spring Boot**:

   a. **Setup**: Include necessary dependencies in your `pom.xml` if you're using Maven or `build.gradle` if you're using Gradle. In Spring Boot, dependencies are managed automatically via starters. For a Spring MVC application, you typically need `spring-boot-starter-web`.

   b. **Create Model**: Define a Java class to represent the data. In our example, it's a `Book` class with attributes like title, author, etc.

   c. **Create Controller**: Define a controller class to handle requests and manage the flow of data. This class will have methods annotated with `@RequestMapping` or more specific annotations like `@GetMapping`, `@PostMapping`, etc. For example, a `BookController` class with methods to handle requests related to books like `getAllBooks()`, `getBookById()`, `addBook()`, etc.

   d. **Create Views**: Create HTML files to display data. These files reside in the `src/main/resources/templates` directory in a Spring Boot project. For example, `books.html` to display a list of books.

   e. **Run the Application**: With Spring Boot, you don't need to deploy your application to a separate server. You can run it as a standalone Java application, and Spring Boot's embedded Tomcat server will start automatically.

**5. Example Code**:

**Book.java**:
```java
public class Book {
    private Long id;
    private String title;
    private String author;
    // Constructors, getters, and setters
}
```

**BookController.java**:
```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/books")
public class BookController {

    @Autowired
    private BookService bookService;

    @GetMapping
    public List<Book> getAllBooks() {
        return bookService.getAllBooks();
    }

    @GetMapping("/{id}")
    public Book getBookById(@PathVariable Long id) {
        return bookService.getBookById(id);
    }

    @PostMapping
    public Book addBook(@RequestBody Book book) {
        return bookService.addBook(book);
    }

    // Other methods for updating and deleting books
}
```

**books.html**:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Books</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>List of Books</h1>
    <ul>
        <li th:each="book : ${books}">
            <span th:text="${book.title}"></span> - <span th:text="${book.author}"></span>
        </li>
    </ul>
</body>
</html>
```

In this example, `BookController` handles requests related to books. When you run the application, you can access `books.html` at `http://localhost:8080/books`. The `BookController` will provide the data to populate this HTML page.

That's a simplified explanation of Spring MVC using Spring Boot with examples.


SPRING MVC VS SPRING BOOT

Sure, let's compare Spring MVC and Spring Boot:

**Spring MVC**:

1. **Framework**: Spring MVC is a web framework provided by the Spring Framework for building web applications in Java.
  
2. **Configuration**: In Spring MVC, you need to configure various components manually, including DispatcherServlet, ViewResolver, etc., typically through XML or Java configuration.
  
3. **Dependency Management**: You need to manage dependencies manually by including them in your project's build configuration files (like `pom.xml` for Maven or `build.gradle` for Gradle).
  
4. **Boilerplate Code**: Spring MVC often requires writing a considerable amount of boilerplate code for setting up the application context, handling requests, configuring views, etc.

**Spring Boot**:

1. **Tool**: Spring Boot is not a framework but a tool that simplifies the setup and configuration of Spring-based applications.
  
2. **Convention over Configuration**: Spring Boot follows the principle of convention over configuration, which means it provides sensible defaults for most configurations. It reduces the need for explicit configuration.
  
3. **Embedded Server**: Spring Boot includes an embedded web server (like Tomcat, Jetty, or Undertow), so you don't need to deploy your application to a separate server. You can run it as a standalone Java application.
  
4. **Dependency Management**: Spring Boot manages dependencies automatically through starters. Starters are a set of convenient dependency descriptors that you can include in your application. For example, including `spring-boot-starter-web` automatically brings in all dependencies required to build a web application.
  
5. **Simplified Configuration**: With Spring Boot, you can configure your application with minimal XML or Java configuration. Most configurations can be done through properties files (`application.properties` or `application.yml`), annotations, or even convention-based configuration.

**Comparison**:

- **Ease of Setup**: Spring Boot significantly reduces the effort required to set up a Spring-based application compared to Spring MVC, which involves more manual configuration.
  
- **Dependency Management**: Spring Boot simplifies dependency management through starters, while in Spring MVC, you need to manage dependencies manually.
  
- **Convention over Configuration**: Spring Boot promotes convention over configuration, reducing the need for explicit configuration, whereas Spring MVC requires more explicit configuration.
  
- **Embedded Server**: Spring Boot comes with an embedded server, making it easier to deploy and run applications without the need for external server setup, which is not the case in Spring MVC.

In summary, Spring Boot builds upon the Spring Framework and enhances it with opinionated configurations and tools to make development easier and faster. It's particularly useful for microservices and rapid application development. Spring MVC, on the other hand, is a part of the Spring Framework and provides a robust framework for building web applications, but with more manual configuration and setup compared to Spring Boot.
